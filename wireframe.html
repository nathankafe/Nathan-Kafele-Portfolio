				<p>Figma is a program that allows the user to easily create wireframes for websites. It is very simple to use and allows for multiple people to edit a single file, which is essential when working in a team. First, our team needed to determine our missions for the site. After determining what each of us wanted through the card sort and multiple team meetings. What we agreed is that we wanted to:</p>

				<ul>
					<li>Make the site more modern.</li>
					<li>Make the site easier to navigate.</li>
					<li>Make the site's information easier to digest.</li>
				</ul>

				<p>Looking at the original website design, it was clear that the creators wanted to grab people’s attention by using a brighter green and blue to highlight key information on each page. The main weakness of the website was that the information was poorly organized. There were times when the alignment of information was all over the place, specifically on the homepage. Other pages such as the Programs and Services page, had pictures that were bigger than others. So, the main thing to focus on was to restructure these pages to fulfil the design goals we had in place.</p>

				<p>After determining the main problems of the site, we then set off to create wireframe drafts. We were each in charge of our own set of pages and I was assigned the <scan class="heavy">ACTIVITY CENTERS, WELLNESS, and the GET INVOLVED</scan> volunteer and employment pages. Additionally, I helped out whenever I could on other pages to make sure we were all on the same page of design.</p>
