						<h2>Card Sort Project</h2>
						<p>TECM 3010 is an advanced technical communications (TECM) course centered around giving students an understanding of the different paths they can take with their technical communications degree. Since TECM is such a flexible degree, with a TECM student being able to apply it to many different professions, this class tackled many different procedures and skills that students could use in the future. This specific project focused on card sorting for a website.</p>

						<p>The old website was randomly organized in a way that would be confusing for anybody, let alone an elderly person with limited knowledge of technology. Each heading used in the drop-down menu was too vague and required the user to click on the dropdown option to get an idea of where it would take you. When first going over the website, my goals for this project were to:</p>
						<ul>
							<li>Make each header more easily identifiable.</li>
							<li>Make a more organized dropdown menu.</li>
						</ul>

						<p>The first step of the project was to separate into teams that would then complete a card sort of the website and then create wireframes for the new design. Each of our team members set out to complete our own version of reorganization. Keeping my goals in mind, I wanted to take inspiration from other websites and just have a straightforward naming system for my headings. After going through the current heading titles, I decided to rename them:</p>
						<ul>
							<li>Home Page</li>
							<li>Programs and Activities</li>
							<li>Staff and Employment</li>
							<li>How to Help</li>
							<li>Calendar and Events</li>
							<li>Contact Page</li>
						</ul>
						
						<p>After creating new heading titles, I reorganized the drop-down pages to further organize the menu. For example, the Programs and Activities drop down would include everything to know about their activity centers and promote their wellness classes. How to Help would be a place where users could donate to the organization’s cause.</p>

					<p>After completing the card sort, I then compared it with my team to see what our card sorts had in common. We then compile them into a “master card sort”, which lists all of our ideas to have a compiled document where we could reference for the next step of the project: <a href="wireframe.html">the wireframe project</a>.</p>
