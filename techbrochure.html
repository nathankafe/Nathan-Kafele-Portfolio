						<h2>Technical Brochure</h2>
						<p>TECM 4190 is a technical editing course and focuses on the reorganization of information for the user’s benefit. Students learn about correcting grammar and writing in a way that is more easily digestible to the user of a document. One of the big projects of this course was to compile a technical document of our choice to apply what we learn in the course to assemble a technically edited document. For my document, I decided to write a brochure of one of my favorite games, Pokémon UNITE, and addressed it to a new player who wanted to play the game. I wanted my brochure to explain the game and address gameplay, unique features, and anything that could become important to them while they play.</p>

						<p>For the technical brochure, I did research through official sources and fan organized sources. All this information would then be put into a “master file” that I could pull from to curate a finalized document. From the “master file” I then edited the information to make each bit of information more digestible and adhered to TECM mission statement: to be clear and concise.</p>

						<p>After that, I then gathered all the images that would be used in my technical document that could visually represent the information I was presenting. The images, however, had to be copyright free, so using sources such as Wikipedia were vital to get royalty free images.</p>

						<p>After gathering all my information and images, I went into Adobe InDesign and designed a standard brochure. For the design of my brochure, I wanted to make it child friendly and nostalgic, so I used the official Pokémon font and colors for the cover of the book. I then tried to make each page reference old Pokémon anime episode title cards. I wanted the book to be a true love letter to the old Pokémon while relaying current information.</p>
